# GPA-Calculator
A simple CLI tool that calculates a person's GPA.

# How it works
The program takes in the course code, course mark, and the course credit units. Then it uses the table below to get the grade point.

| Letter Grade | Grade Point | Marks/Score |
| :---:        |     :---:   |       :---: |
| A   | 5.0     | 70-100    |
| B   | 4.0     | 60-69     |
| C   | 3.0     | 50-59     |
| D   | 2.0     | 45-49     |
| E   | 1.0     | 40-44     |
| F   | 0.0     | 0-39      |

Then it finds out the Quality Points and adds them up to get the Total.
It also finds out the total course credit units.
Quality Points = Course Credit Unit * Grade Point

The GPA is gotten by dividing the Total Quality Points by the Total Course Credit Units.

The method of calculating the GPA used is The University of Lagos version.
